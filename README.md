# Adaptive Programming Class

# Creators:
Adam Troszczyński,
Adrian Fijałkowski.

# Purpose:
If you're reading this, you probably know the purpose, but to shorten it up for you:
This 'place' contains the project we are working on for out classes. It is supposed to contain
a program that can read classes and their connection from the DLL or EXE file and visualise it 
for a human eye. As for now the project is basically empty, but over time contents will appear.

Thanks for reading. We will keep you updated :)
